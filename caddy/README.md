# Caddy

Caddy will magically handle requests to your local doamain (in my case `thinkcentre.home`) and its subdomains and redirect every request to the right docker container and port. Figuring out the right reverse proxy rule for a certain service is kind of a pain sometimes but generally you don't need have to do anything else other than adding a `reverse_proxy` rule in the `Caddyfile` if you decide to use a subdomain instead of a subdirectory as your reverse proxy target.

## Let's Encrypt Certificate

For my Caddy configuration I decided to use a wildcard certificate so that I only have to add a single cert, generated by Caddy with Let's Encrypt, on my devices instead of one for each domain and subdomain. Depending on your use case you might have to add the certificate in your system-level or program-level certificates store.
